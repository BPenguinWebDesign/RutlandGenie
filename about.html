        <p>
          I am a qualified teacher and tutor with over 26 years of teaching experience in both the primary and secondary sectors.
          I offer tuition in Maths, Biology, Physics and Chemistry to GCSE level, Maths to AS level and Biology to A level. I also
          provide tuition in all subjects at Key Stage 1, 2 and 3 including music and French, and can help with school entrance
          exam preparation. I am fun, enthusiastic and creative, and have experience with a variety of special needs issues such
          as ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, ASD and anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have excellent interpersonal and communication skills, aiming to inspire, motivate and encourage each of my students
          tailoring to their individual needs. I have a warm and friendly manner and am sensitive and understanding, with a wealth
          of experience in handling teenage issues. I use my initiative to meet and resolve any challenges. I am both diligent and
          conscientious and have high personal standards. Also, I am reliable and dependable, enjoying completing tasks well.
          Finally, I am highly organised and am aware of both big picture and fine details to get the very best out of my
          students.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a committed Christian and regularly play my violin and sing in the worship band. I have 2 grown up boys, one with
          autism, and so I understand many challenges from both parent and teacher points of view. I love the outdoors and am
          happiest up a mountain or kayaking down a river.
